Research Group "Machine Learning and Social Computing" has arisen from studentsâ€™ projects and scientific research combining digital social sciences and informatics, which has been developing in our campus since 2013.

The activity of our group is directed towards developing machine learning and network science methods in social computing settings, employed to analyze data from various Social Network sites and other online platforms, where we can observe social interaction between individuals.
